I'm Sahiti. I'm a graduate of the MSc Engineering and Policy Analysis Program, TU Delft from the batch of 2021. I
currently see myself as a jack of all trades and a master of none. This belief allowed to dabble with policy
storytelling, building simulation models, justice in transboundary water resources, gender, disaster risk management and
climate change.

## My contribution to the project

I worked on the HERoS project in its very initial days where we were picking which countries to build the model for.
Within the model building, I was deeply involved in building the epidemiological model and the activities schedules of
the agent-citizens of The Hague. For the epidemiological model, I was helping collect data and conceptualize the model
that was then coded in Java. For the activity schedules, we originally manually constructed activity schedules for the
entire population of The Hague and eventually moved on to using the Time Use Survey data released by The Netherlands to
automate the creation of schedules. Both these components formed the crux of my contribution.

## Key takeaways from the project

1. Model building must always start small and the complexity should increase over time. With HERoS we aimed slightly
   higher in the beginning and struggled a little bit but eventually got a hang of the complexity of modelling.
2. The project was a colossal effort by multiple people and over time, I realized the importance of standardized
   practices, clearly communicating requirements and reiterating final objectives while working in large teams.

## Memories created during the project

The penultimate day (or what felt like) of submitting the HERoS report, we finally got our final output data to perform
Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty which the entire team was very excited to do. We were all in the comfort/stink of
our own homes working on this model continuously for about a week by then. The look on our faces when we finally had
data to read was quite unparalleled to any other feeling we had on the project.
