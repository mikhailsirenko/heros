My research on Decisions and ICT for Resilience combines the behavioural aspects of how people use information in
decision-making with the normative aspects on how decisions should or need to be made. I am especially interested in
complex and time-compressed situations where decisions nevertheless have long-term strategic implications. My research
situated in an emerging and interdisciplinary field that connects the decision and information sciences with the
literature on disaster management & logistics risk and resilience.

## My contribution to the project

I am the PI for the HERoS project, overseeing the work on the different work packages, in which TU Delft is involved:
epidemiological modeling, supply chain management, and misinformation. I am especially interested in the impact of the
models on decision-making - and excited about this phase of the project, where we start to combine the local insights at
city level with the regional and global spread of the pandemic.

## Key takeaways from the project

Complexity and uncertainty are hard to communicate. Here, we need to further investigate tools and methods - and develop
partnerships with policy-makers.

## Memories created during the project

We were writing the HERoS project proposal - a full H2020 grant with 100+ pages- in less than 2 weeks, which was an
amazing experience with the whole team dedicated to it night and day. And even though we never got a chance to meet face
to face in the first year (see Kick-off meeting picture), I really appreciate the team spirit in the project.
