I am an MSc student in the Engineering & Policy Analysis program. I am interested to understand how to reduce the impact
of infectious diseases (e.g. COVID-19) on our society. I believe that better understanding can save lives and improve
wellbeing. As a primary tool for my research, I use agent-based modelling. It is a widely used simulation paradigm to
study complex systems. Infectious diseases, in their turn, are a great example of complex systems since they affect
almost every aspect of people's life. In collaboration with the national statistical agency of the Netherlands, I
investigate how these models work with different types of data: public and micro. In my free time I can be found on the
water, using the wind to propel me to new heights.

## My contribution to the project

Within the HERoS project, I work on the synthesis of the agent population based on different sources of data, open and
micro. My current research focuses on the differences between these synthetic populations and the resulting outcomes of
the HERoS model.

## Key takeaways from the project

- Creating sensible agent populations is difficult
- The devil is in the details

## Memories created during the project

As stated in the documentation, I quote: "0 stands for 1"
