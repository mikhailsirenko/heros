Coming from Malaysia, my mission is mainly driven by the search for good food. Beyond that, in mostly equal measure and
in no particular order, I care about how instruments of the modelling and simulation field can best be used for decision
support, how data can be used for supporting those tools, and how these tools, resources and knowledge can be channeled
towards seeking solutions to problems related to urbanization and climate change.

## My contribution to the project

In the earlier days of the HERoS project, I supported model conceptualization and implementation activities. I also
contributed to development of the synthetic population used in the model, and to writing of the report.

## Key takeaways from the project

I remember most the techniques used to downscale from aggregated (census) data in order to generate the synthetic
population. and also that deadlines are a pretty good way to get a project moving.

## Memories created during the project

When the long hours and late nights (triggered by an upcoming deadline) culminated in us being able to implement and
analyze a range of scenarios in the model :) that was a goodie.
