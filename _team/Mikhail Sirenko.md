Hello there! Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher on the Horizon 2020 project HERoS at the Delft University of
Technology. I have a degree in statistics (quite theoretical) which I enhanced with a program in simulation & modelling
for policy analysis (more practical). I aim to understand how cities recover, adapt, or transform in uncertain future
events like pandemics, heatwaves, or segregation. As you can see, I study the intersection of urban science, resilience
and uncertainty. Method-wise, I do machine learning and simulation and modelling.

## My contribution to the project

There are many!My primary task was to combine everything and in the right way. Cities are complex, and it took me a
while to understand what we need to model and at what level of detail to understand the virus spread. Being able to zoom
in into the model, code one specific element and then zoom out and think about how everything is connected required some
high-level mental gymnastic skills.

## Key takeaways from the project

Showing a bunch of graphs to policymakers did not generate a loud "aha!" in any of the Zoom meetings. Everything went
much smoother when we switched to "storytelling with data." That was the very first step in better communicating science
to policymakers.

## Memories created during the project

The night before the submission, around 5 am, I worked on the report in an online document. I enjoyed the music, and
everything felt alright; who doesn't like to work at night? There was still quite some work to do, spell check, adding
figures and actual writing, so I didn't count that I would finish before 1 pm. But then I saw something strange â€” two
new icons in the right top corner of the document: Anonymous Pumpkin and Anonymous Quokka. Sahiti and Jin came early
morning to help finish the report (even though they had completed their work)! That was an awesome moment, and we
managed to finish everything (an hour) earlier! Still remember the music and the feeling of how much better it is to
work in a great team.
