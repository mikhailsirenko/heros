Alexander Verbraeck is a full professor in Systems and Simulation in the Policy Analysis Group of the Faculty of
Technology, Policy and Management of Delft University of Technology. He is a specialist in discrete event simulation,
agent-based simulation, data-driven simulation, and serious gaming with a focus on heavily distributed environments and
the use of real-time data. Application projects are in Logistics, Supply Chains and Transportation, Health, and Safety
and Security.

## My contribution to the project

While traditional models of disease outbreaks largely focus on infection rates, new methods are needed to describe
behavior from the bottom up and integrate this in macro-level models to coordinate pandemic response worldwide. From TU
Delft we work on developing the large-scale simulation models that combine agent-based approaches with discrete-event
simulation techniques for disease speed, by which we can test the policies at different policy levels. The MedLabs
simulation tool suite, which is a combined ABM-DEVS model, is able to execute agent-based behavioral models of the
population (up to millions of agents) to study disease spread under different circumstances and policies.

## Key takeaways from the project

It is quite difficult to create 'local' models, for instance of a city. Cities have a large influx and outflow of
persons with the neighboring cities and the larger system, contributing to introduction of disease or spread of the
disease beyond the city limits. Choosing the 'right' boundary or modeling the external influences is quite a challenge,
and at the moment, still unsolved.
