Srijith Balakrishnan is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Singapore-ETH Centre, Singapore, and a Resilience Fellow at the
4TU Federation, the Netherlands. He completed his doctoral research at the Department of Civil, Architectural, and
Environmental Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin in August 2020. He is interested in developing and
applying generic- and infrastructure-specific frameworks, methods, and metrics to evaluate the risk and resilience of
interdependent infrastructure systems. He holds an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering from the the University of
Kerala and a master's degree in Civil Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

## My contribution to the project

I have been involved in developing a transport submodel for the city of Hague as part of the MEDLABS urban simulation
model. I used various public and proprietary datasets and developed predictive models for people's travel mode choices
based on their socio-demographic characteristics. Apart from that, I also analyzed public transit data and created tools
to extract, process, and synthesize transit schedule data as input to the transport submodel.

## Key takeaways from the project

It has been a great experience being part of an interdisciplinary project. I have been working with people from diverse
research backgrounds who provide new perspectives and insights during every meeting. I could learn new things in
programming and data analytics, which has helped me in other projects.
