I am an international student from India with a background in policy advocacy and regulatory governance in the energy
sector. My research interests lie in tackling complex societal challenges through data-driven and evidence-based
policymaking rooted in quantitative modelling and simulation.

## My contribution to the project

During my first year of my Master's, I had an opportunity to associate with TPM Resilience Lab to enhance my data
science, visualisation and analytics skills. At the HERoS project, I contributed to building the location sub-model for
the Hague. This included curating the different various opensource location datasets and combining them to make coherent
and reliable location data representing the real-life point of interest (POI) such as grocery stores, schools, offices,
etc. In addition to this, I collaborated in creating a research poster to showcase key findings of the study at the
International Conference for Computational Social Science - 2021.

## Key takeaways from the project

Associating with the HERos project has been a rewarding experience for me. I gained hands-on experience in data
cleaning, exploratory analysis, data preparation and visualization. Apart from technical skills, the most enriching
experience was working with this amazing team of researchers and scholars at TPM Resilience Lab that supported and
encouraged me throughout this journey.

## Memories created during the project

I learned a very critical life skill from Mikhail during preparing a poster for IC2S2, the skill of producing
high-quality memes. We spent over 30 minutes finding the office episode and extracting the meme which was later featured
on the poster and served as the perfect attention grabber.
