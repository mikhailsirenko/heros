PhD researcher at the Urban Economics group and research fellow at the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan
Solutions (AMS Institute). I studied Engineering and Policy Analysis (MS) at TU Delft and Statistics (MS) at Universidad
Nacional from Colombia. My research aims to understand how to measure welfare in a broader perspective at the urban and
regional scales. My goal is to illuminate creating more sustainable, resilient and equitable cities. I am interested in
applying econometrics, machine learning, simulation and modelling methods to understand urban socio-economic complex
systems.

## My contribution to the project

I analyzed the patterns of citizens' daily activities for the Harries county and The Hague. To do so, I participated in
co-designing the methodology to estimate the probabilities of performing activities in hourly, daily and weekly basis.
Moreover, I designed a validation scheme based on subsequent simulation steps to understand the methodology performance.
These results aimed to improve the ABM citizen's submodel to find insights into the performance of policy interventions
to contain the spread of COVID-19.

## Key takeaways from the project

I have learned three main aspects. Firstly, I learned the importance of ABM Modelling to strengthen policy analysis.
Secondly, I improved my data analysis and visualization expertise due to this project required to translate complex
patterns of daily activities into concrete metrics. Third, I learned how to work with people from around the globe.
Undoubtedly, this last project contributed a lot to find a new challenge as researcher in my life.

## Memories created during the project

I would like to thank Mikhail Sirenko. I not only enriched my professional skills due to his guidance but also I found a
good friend in the right moment.
