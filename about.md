The overall objective of HERoS is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the response to the Covid-19 outbreak
by generating actionable knowledge four areas: governance, models in epidemics, medical supply chains, online
misinformation.

## Governance
HERoS seeks to understand and model different co-ordination structures and governance arrangements. The
objective is to identify bottlenecks; develop procedures for efficient information sharing across countries and
hierarchical levels; and to propose policies for improved crisis governance, focusing on responders to public health
emergencies. 

## Epidemiological and behavioural modelling
HERoS models the impact of local policies and human behaviour on the spread of
the disease. The aim is to guide public decision-making in conditions of deep uncertainty.

## Medical supply chain management
HERoS evaluates the impact of cascading effects across global supply chains and provides
recommendations to improve management of medical supply chains.

## Online misinformation
HERoS studies the co-spead of online misinformation and fact-checks with the aim of developing a
new method to retrieve actionable information from social media in order to detect rumours and misinformation early.
