HERoS is a Horizon 2020 project funded under the ‘SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020 – Advancing knowledge for the clinical and
public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic’ call. As a social sciences research project, HERoS addresses the need
to understand the social dynamics of the outbreak and the related public health response. The work will be conducted
between April 2020 and 2023.

[Check the project page](https://www.heros-project.eu/) for more information.

## HERoS at TU Delft TPM Resilience Lab

At the TPM Resilience lab, we are looking at the urban health emergency system through the lens of epidemiological and
behavioural modelling. We are building an agent-based model using open data and open source software to devise
actionable policy inputs and strategies to support decision makers for improving crisis response during pandemic.
